🔐 Mobile Money Fraud Detection System
A real-time fraud detection system for mobile money platforms that automatically flags suspicious transactions, alerts compliance officers, and provides regulators with actionable insights. This solution leverages machine learning and system architecture integration to provide robust fraud mitigation and regulatory compliance support.

🚀 Overview
The system features a real-time integrated frontend through which 

transaction data is continuously ingested into the prediction engine.
 
It performs automated data preprocessing and analyzes each transaction 

to determine whether it is fraudulent or legitimate. 

The engine employs a hybrid detection approach that combines embedded rules, 

machine learning (ML), and neural network (NN) models for enhanced accuracy.
 
When a suspicious transaction is identified, the system immediately sends 

alerts to relevant stakeholders. Additionally, it includes an interactive
 
dashboard that provides real-time monitoring of transaction trends and visual 

analytics of detected fraudulent activities.

📱 Key Features
🧠 Hybrid ML Model (LSTM + Random Forest) for high fraud detection precision.

🔔 Real-Time Alerting System for compliance and regulators.

📱 Mobile App Integration to provide users with transaction transparency.

📊 Interactive Dashboards for transaction analytics and fraud patterns.

🔒 Secure API Architecture with audit trails and regulatory data sharing.
